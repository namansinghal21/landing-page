                    He describes himself as an alpha-male, merciless, and insatiable. His mantra? "I think, would an idiot do that? And if they do, I do not do that thing." Also the company's best salesperson.

                    Coolest guy in the office. Good-looking, funny, charming, and kinda has a crush on the receptionist. Does okay at sales.

                    Our receptionist Pam. If you think she's cute now, you should've seen her a couple years ago. Not too good at her job though, spends too much time talking to sales.

                    Oscar, accountant extraordinaire. Great guy, really smart, but I wouldn't get too close to him because his stick's a little bent, if you know what I mean.
